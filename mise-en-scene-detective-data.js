    question: "Which mise-en-scène element most clearly suggests that the teenager feels overwhelmed by school work?",
    answers: [
      {
        text: "The piles of open textbooks and sticky notes covering the desk",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "The cluttered study materials act as props that visually represent the pressure of school work."
      },
      {
        text: "The blue poster on the wall behind the bed",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "The poster is background decoration, but it doesn’t directly communicate the feeling of being overwhelmed."
      },
      {
        text: "The neat stack of folded clothes in the corner",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Neatly folded clothes would suggest organisation, not stress or overload."
      },
      {
        text: "The window showing a bright, sunny day outside",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "The weather outside contrasts the mood, but the props on the desk show the stress more clearly."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Props are being used symbolically here: the overloaded desk and scattered notes make the pressure of revision visible."

  {
    id: "interview_office",
    title: "Job interview in a bright office",
    focus: "Costume & body language",
    image: "img/mise-office-interview.png",
    question: "How does the candidate's costume and body language show they are nervous and unsure?",
    answers: [
      {
        text: "Their suit is slightly too big and they are gripping their portfolio tightly on their lap",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "The oversized suit and tense grip combine to show inexperience and anxiety."
      },
      {
        text: "They are sitting close to the table with their back straight",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "An upright posture usually suggests confidence rather than nervousness."

      {
        text: "They are wearing a bright red tie that stands out",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "A bold tie might stand out visually, but it doesn’t clearly show nervousness on its own."
      },
      {
        text: "They have a neat folder and a pen placed carefully on the table",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Organised props suggest preparation, not necessarily uncertainty."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Costume and body language work together to build character. An ill-fitting suit and tense posture hint that the character feels out of place."

        text: "Only one flickering overhead light is on, leaving long pools of shadow along the corridor",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "Low, uneven lighting with deep shadows makes the space feel unsafe and unpredictable."
      },
      {
        text: "Every light is on at full brightness, making the corridor look very clear and open",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Bright, even lighting usually reduces tension because everything is visible."
      },
      {
        text: "The corridor is lit with soft pink and orange fairy lights",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Warm, decorative lights might feel cosy rather than threatening."
      },
      {
        text: "A bright spotlight shines directly onto the school logo at the far end",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This directs attention to the logo, not to a sense of threat or danger."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Horror and thriller scenes often use patchy, directional lighting so that parts of the frame are hidden in shadow."

  {
    id: "rooftop_hero",
    title: "Hero alone on the rooftop at sunset",
    focus: "Framing & position in frame",
    image: "img/mise-rooftop-hero.png",
    question: "How does the framing of the hero most strongly create the idea that they are powerful and in control?",
    answers: [
      {
        text: "They are placed in a low-angle shot, standing near the edge with the city skyline behind them",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "A low-angle shot makes the character look larger and more dominant, especially with the city below them."
      },
      {
        text: "They are placed in a high-angle shot, viewed from above as they sit on the floor",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "High-angle shots usually make characters look small or vulnerable, not powerful."
      },
      {
        text: "They are filmed in an extreme long shot, almost lost in the distance",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "A very distant shot reduces the character’s presence instead of emphasising their power."
      },
      {
        text: "They are shown in a mid-shot sitting at a desk",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "A neutral mid-shot doesn’t strongly suggest dominance or control in this context."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Camera angle and position in the frame affect status. Low angles and high viewpoints over the city often suggest control and heroism."
  },
  {
    id: "hospital_waiting_room",
    title: "Silent hospital waiting room",
    focus: "Props & set dressing",
    image: "img/mise-hospital-waiting-room.png",

      {
        text: "A bright, colourful mural painted on the wall for children",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This adds warmth to the room but doesn’t clearly show a long wait."

      {
        text: "A television in the corner showing a wildlife documentary",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "The TV content doesn’t directly communicate the characters’ emotional state."

        text: "A pot plant on the reception desk",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "The plant decorates the space but doesn’t tell us about the waiting experience."

    id: "warehouse_villain",
    title: "Villain in the warehouse",
    focus: "Lighting & silhouette",
    image: "img/mise-warehouse-villain.png",
    question: "How does the lighting make the villain seem threatening in this scene?",
    answers: [
      {
        text: "They are backlit so their face is in shadow, creating a dark silhouette",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "Backlighting hides facial detail and turns the character into a shadowy figure, which feels more menacing."

      {
        text: "They are lit evenly from the front with a soft key light",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Soft, even lighting tends to make characters look open and approachable."
      },
      {
        text: "They stand directly under a bright white spotlight",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "A single spotlight can be dramatic, but if it reveals their face clearly it is less mysterious."
      },
      {
        text: "They are lit from below with a torch while smiling",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Uplighting can be creepy, but the description focuses more on the expression than a clear sense of threat."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Lighting that hides rather than reveals a character often makes them feel more dangerous or untrustworthy."
  },
  {
    id: "cafe_date",
    title: "Candlelit café date",
    focus: "Colour & lighting",
    image: "img/mise-cafe-date.png",
    question: "Which description best explains how the mise-en-scène suggests a warm, romantic mood?",

        text: "Soft, warm lighting from candles and fairy lights, with rich reds and golds in the background",
        correct: true,

      {
        text: "Harsh white fluorescent lights and pale blue walls",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Cold colours and harsh lighting would feel more clinical than romantic."
      },
      {
        text: "Bright green strip lighting with neon signs everywhere",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Neon lighting feels energetic or chaotic, not gently romantic."
      },
      {
        text: "Only natural daylight coming in from large windows",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Daylight can be pleasant but doesn’t automatically create a romantic tone."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Colour temperature and light quality are key to mood: warm, low-level lighting usually reads as cosy or romantic."

    id: "exam_classroom",
    title: "Exam hall tension",
    focus: "Framing & depth",
    image: "img/mise-exam-classroom.png",
    question: "Which framing choice most clearly shows the pressure of the exam on one student?",
    answers: [
      {
        text: "A shallow depth-of-field shot where one nervous student in the foreground is sharp and all other students blur into the background",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "Focusing on just one student isolates their experience and makes us share their stress."
      },
      {
        text: "A wide shot from the back of the hall so we can see every student equally",
        correct: false,

      {
        text: "A mid-shot of the teacher walking between the rows of desks",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This shifts attention to the teacher, not the student’s anxiety."
      },
      {
        text: "A shot of the clock on the wall as the second hand moves",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "The clock shows time pressure but doesn’t focus on one student’s emotional response."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Selective focus directs attention. Blurring the background students lets the audience concentrate on a single stressed character."
  },

    title: "Gaming streamer setup",
    focus: "Colour & props",
    image: "img/mise-gaming-streamer.png",
    question: "How does the mise-en-scène clearly show that the character is a gaming content creator?",
    answers: [
      {
        text: "RGB lighting behind a dual‑monitor setup, a high‑quality microphone and a webcam facing the character",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "These props are strongly associated with streaming and online content creation."
      },
      {
        text: "A single small TV in the corner of the room with the sound turned down",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This doesn’t communicate professional streaming – it feels more like casual watching."
      },
      {
        text: "A bookshelf full of classic novels behind the character",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This suggests a different type of character, not specifically a gamer or streamer."
      },
      {
        text: "A basic laptop on a dining table with no other equipment",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This is too generic to clearly show they are a dedicated gaming creator."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Specific props like microphones, webcams and RGB lighting anchor the scene firmly in the world of streaming."

      {
        text: "One student stands alone in the foreground while three others cluster together behind them, half‑turning away",
        correct: true,
        feedback: "Separating the single student from the group in the frame makes the isolation visually obvious."
      },
      {
        text: "All four students stand in a straight line facing the camera",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This symmetrical arrangement doesn’t clearly show who is isolated."

      {
        text: "The group stands in a circle with the camera in the middle",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This gives a sense of inclusion rather than exclusion."

      {
        text: "Only the empty playground is shown with no characters",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Without characters, it’s hard to show who is being left out."
      }
    ],
    explanation: "Blocking – where characters stand in relation to each other – is a powerful way to show relationships like power or exclusion."
  },
  {
    id: "news_reporter_night",
    title: "News reporter at night",
    focus: "Lighting & costume",
    image: "img/mise-news-reporter-night.png",

      {
        text: "The reporter wears bright fancy‑dress costume in the middle of a party",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "This breaks the serious, professional tone expected from news coverage."

      {
        text: "The reporter stands completely in shadow with no microphone",
        correct: false,
        feedback: "Without clear lighting or a microphone, it’s harder to recognise the news convention."
